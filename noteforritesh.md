no create-react-app :(
    
Im using a sass compiler, so ill just write instructions on how you can use it.

Get this VSCODE extention:

"Live Sass Compiler"

if ur using atom, use vscode >:(
    

after you install go to the sass file, there should be a "watch sass" on the bottom bar of the window (vscode)


Once sass is watched, any save you make will be automatically compiled.
